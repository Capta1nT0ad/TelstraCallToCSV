## Tutorial

This is a beginners' guide which assumes basic knowledge of computers. If you need help, please open a Discussion and tag it appropriately.

**Estimated time: 15 minutes**

### Step 1: Getting your Key
(Relevant for Firefox, Safari with Developer Mode enabled and Google Chrome/Chromium. Most other browsers support this method in some way or another, but they are not consistent with this documentation. Screenshots are from Firefox. **Important: If you are on Android, you can download Kiwi Browser from the Play Store which has the necessary developer tools to follow this tutorial.**)

Go to [https://myservices.telstra.com.au](https://myservices.telstra.com.au).

Enter your e-mail address, then press `Continue`.

Right-click anywhere on the following page, and click `Inspect` or `Inspect Element`, depending on your browser. The same can also be accomplished using `Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-I` in Firefox, or the F12 key in most browsers.

Then, navigate to `Response` and copy the value in `access_token`.
Paste it somewhere you can access later. Do not share it with anybody.

**The access token will expire after your session times out. If this happens, get the access token again using these steps..**

In the `Filter URLs` box, type `fetch-payment-reference` and click on the second item.

Then, navigate to `Request` in the new sidebar and copy the value in `accountUUID`.
Paste it somewhere you can access later. Do not share it with anybody.

Unlike the Access Token, the Account UUID is permanent and will not expire.

### Step 2: Using TelstraCallToCSV
TelstraCallToCSV requires a GNU/Linux, Windows or Mac computer with [Python 3](https://python.org/download) installed. **If you do not already have Python 3 installed, please download it using that link.**
	
**Required Reading**

Depending on your operating system, you need to open one of the following applications:

- GNU/Linux: The terminal emulator you have installed, such as Konsole or GNOME Terminal
- Windows: Command Prompt or PowerShell
- macOS: Terminal, or another terminal emulator you have installed such as iTerm2.
- Android: Get [F-Droid](f-droid.org), an app store for open-source applications. From F-Droid, download Termux and use that to enter the commands from this tutorial. Do not download Termux from the Play Store.

All of these applications will give you a text prompt that looks something like this:

GNU/Linux, macOS or Android:
```sh
user@computer ~ $
```

Windows:
```
C:\>
```

When this tutorial says to 'run' a command, it means to paste it in to this application and press Enter.

**Installing**

We need to download and install TelstraCallToCSV. We can do this using Python's `pip` package manager, which allows us to easily install TelstraCallToCSV and its dependencies in a single command from a central software repository for usage with Python.

Run the following command to download and install TelstraCallToCSV from PyPi, the Python Package Index:

GNU/Linux, macOS or Android:
```sh
python3 -m pip install telstracalltocsv
```

Windows:
```
py -m pip install telstracalltocsv
```

This command will output some text as it downloads and installs TelstraCallToCSV and its dependencies, but no interaction is required.

**Configuring**

TelstraCallToCSV has a built in configuration file which is not set up by default. Before running TelstraCallToCSV, you must set this up:

GNU/Linux, macOS or Android:
```sh
python3 -m telstracalltocsv --configure
```

Windows:
```
py -m telstracalltocsv --configure
```

You will be prompted for your Account UUID and your Phone Number. Type or copy in the information, then press Enter.


**Running**

Finally, run TelstraCallToCSV, substituting `<key>` with your key gathered from Step 1.

GNU/Linux, macOS or Android:
```sh
python3 -m telstracalltocsv <key>
```

Windows:
```
py -m telstracalltocsv <key>
```


TelstraCallToCSV will output something like the following as it downloads, by default, the maximum of 6 months call history.

```
:: Starting export...
   (1/6) ü¢É Downloading YYYYMM... Done.
         üñ´ Saving YYYYMM.csv...  Done.

   (6/6) ü¢É Downloading YYYYMM... Done.
         üñ´ Saving YYYYMM.csv...  Done.

:: Finished all jobs.
```

### You're finished! TelstraCallToCSV has exported your call logs sorted into months into the current folder.

**Extras**

TelstraCallToCSV also features other functions. These are explained using the `--help` or `-h` command. If you are unfamiliar with command-line interface programs, replace `<key>` from the previous step with `--help` or `-h`. You will see the following:

```
usage: TelstraCallToCSV [-h] [-c] [-v] [-C] [--configure] [-P PHONE] [-M MONTHS] [key]

A simple Python program to export Telstra call histories to CSV files.

positional arguments:
  key                   My Telstra session key

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c, --copying         show the license information
  -v, --version         show the version information
  --configure           write/create the configuration file
  -P PHONE, --phone PHONE
                        override the default account phone number in the config
  -M MONTHS, --months MONTHS
                        specify how many months back to download (default: 6, the max)

```

Most notably:

`--configure` allows you to reconfigure your Account UUID and Phone Number. (For advanced users: the configuration file is in JSON and is located in `~/.telstracall`.)

`-P` or `--phone` allows you to specify a phone number to override the one in the configuration. Note that you still need to have a phone number in the configuration even with this option.

`-M` or `--months` allows you to download a specific number of months, rather than the default maximum of 6. (Telstra does not allow you to request back more than 6 months of data, and there is no way to work around this.)
